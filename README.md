# NewYork-Listings
A AirBNB listings dataset from Kaggle was used in this repo. 
I learnt how to learn/extract infromation from raw, unstructured data. 
Performed several EDA on the data.
Used the LinearRegressor, LightGBM models to make predictions.
Root Mean Square Error was the performance metric used to compare the models.
